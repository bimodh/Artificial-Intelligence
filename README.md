# RCHAS - Remote Control Home Appliance System

This is a project developed as a part of my Masters program in Computer Science from California State University for Artificial Intelligence.

The idea of this project is to automate the electronic and electrical devices at home and remotely control it from elsewhere in the world. Sounds crazy?

#Think about a house that

  - Turns on the lights my the time you wake up
  - Coffee being made by the time you fresh up
  - Break fast being cooked ready
  - Remind about shopping lists
  - Turn ON or OFF the appliances even when you are outside of your house
  - Automated temperature control
  - Automated light ambience control
  - Dinner ready by the time you reach back home from office
  - Securely monitor your house
  - And the list goes on and on

Who wouldn't like to live in such a house?

This is a prototype for such a house. There is an assumption that the house has an internet connection with a static IP address.

#Now what?
  Do you want to call your house a name? Register a domain for your house. And there, once we go to your domain and login to your house, we are virtually logging into your house and all the appliances at your home will be listed here. Now we can turn these devices ON or OFF from a remote location.

#Is that it? 
  Absolutely no, here comes the beauty of Artificial Intelligence. The AI module sits and learns what are your daily routines. And once it teaches its system, it will then automate this process. All of your routines becomes a part of this system and it takes care of your house and appliance. Also, add different sensors like light sensor, temperature sensor, pressure sensor to actively monitor and show these information and control them within the virtual house.
